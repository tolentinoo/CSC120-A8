- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    In this homework assignment I used tamagotchi's as inspiration. Sort of like a virtual pet. 
    The contract helps the pet get power ups, grow, rest, examine items, pick/drop the items, fly, walk and shrink. The contract also allows the pet to be re-set to its default self. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    I added a setter that allows the user to change the name of the tamagotchi. Then I added a createPowerUp method that created the arraylist of powerups.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This homework assignment really helped me learn more about implementation of interfaces. I really liked how I knew what was expected from me right off the bat. I think that this lesson would have been helpful to pair with homework assignment A7 since it had similar intructions. I would recommend them to go to TA hours at least once for this assignment. Since there is a lot of freedom with this assignment I really got confused with some parts and going to TA hours helped.
