- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    In this homework assignment I used tamagotchi's as inspiration. Sort of like a virtual pet. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
